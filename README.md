# EDA--For-Viewership
Overview

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) examines BrightTV’s viewership dataset to uncover patterns in user behavior and content consumption.
The goal is to generate insights that support the Customer Value Management (CVM) team in growing the subscription base and boosting daily engagement.

The analysis focuses on:

Data Quality & Metadata – Assessing data completeness, identifying missing values, and explaining each field (e.g., user IDs, session details, timestamps, content types, devices).

User Trends – Measuring active users, viewing frequency, and retention over time.

Consumption Patterns – Exploring peak hours, popular content genres, and session durations across different devices and days of the week.

Drivers of Engagement – Highlighting factors that influence watch time, such as day-of-week effects, device usage, and content preferences.

Key findings will guide:

Content recommendations for low-consumption periods.

User-growth initiatives like targeted campaigns, personalized suggestions, and platform improvements.

By combining descriptive statistics with visual analytics (e.g., time-series plots, distribution charts, and heatmaps), this EDA provides a data-driven foundation for BrightTV’s strategic decision-making.
