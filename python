import pandas as pd        # For data loading and manipulation
import numpy as np         # For numerical computations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For visualizations
import seaborn as sns      # For advanced visualizations
You might also use:

datetime or pandas.to_datetime for handling dates and time zones.

plotly.express for interactive visualizations (optional).
  Understanding & Explaining Metadata

Metadata is the data about your dataset—column names, types, and their meanings.
Steps to examine it:

df.info()        # Data types, null counts
df.describe()    # Summary stats for numerical columns
df.columns       # List of column names
df.head()        # Preview first rows


In the BrightTV context, typical metadata could include:

user_id: Unique identifier for each subscriber.

session_id: Each viewing session.

content_id/title: Program viewed.

start_time / end_time: UTC timestamps of the session.

duration: Minutes or seconds watched.

device / platform: Web, mobile, Smart TV, etc.

region / location: Viewer’s geography.

Convert times to South Africa local time:

df['start_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['start_time'], utc=True).dt.tz_convert('Africa/Johannesburg')
